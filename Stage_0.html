			The Internet is the interconnection of millions of computers. One giant computer <em>network</em>. Some are consuming content using <b>Web Browsers</b> or <b>Email Clients</b>. Some computers are holding those files, and <em>serving</em> them out when they are needed. These are appropriately called <b>Servers</b>.

			When a web browser goes to a url, it is requesting the file(s) for a web site to be sent via <b>HTTP</b> from a server. HTTP is the communication protocal the Internet works on. The server finds the need file(s), then send them back so the web browser can interpet them so they make sense to us lowly humans.
